                                        projects which they will develop over the course of this series in con-junction
                                        with the applied data science directed studies. Students will select a project
                                        along with an advisor and sponsor, develop a written proposal for their work,
                                        and investigate and write a related work survey to refine this proposal with
                                        their findings. Students will begin preliminary design and implementation of
                                        their project. Work will be presented in class for peer review with an emphasis
                                        on developing data science communication skills. This course will keep students

                                        The course provides an overview of data analysis tasks and the associated
                                        challenges, spanning data preprocessing, model building, model evaluation, and
                                        visualization. The major areas of machine learning, such as unsupervised,
                                        semi-supervised and supervised learning are covered by data analysis techniques
                                        including classification, clustering, association analysis, anomaly detection,
                                        and statistical testing. The course includes a series of assignments utilizing
                                        practical datasets from diverse application domains, which are designed to
                                        reinforce the concepts and techniques covered in lectures. A substantial project
                                        related to one or more data sets culminates the course.</div>
