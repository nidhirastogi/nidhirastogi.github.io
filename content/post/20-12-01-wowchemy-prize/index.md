<br>Abstract: </br>Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) has been valuable to SOC analysts investigating emerging and known threats and attacks. However, the reach is still limited, and the adoption could be higher. While CTI has consistently proven to be a rich source of threat indicators and patterns collected by peer security researchers, other researchers have occasionally found them helpful. Challenges include intelligence in the CTI documented in an unstructured format, embedded in a large amount of text, making it challenging to integrate them effectively with existing threat intelligence analysis tools for internal system logs. In this paper, we detail ongoing research in threat intelligence extraction, integration, and analysis at different levels of granularity from unstructured threat analysis reports. We share ongoing challenges and provide recommendations to overcome them.
