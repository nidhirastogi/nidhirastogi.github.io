<br>Abstract: </br> Le Nguyen, recently won 1st Place (Gold) for Best Applications Paper at the UPSTAT23 conference last week!

Le's paper, titled "Graph-based Approach to Studying the Spread of Radical Online Sentiment," addresses the issue of the growing spread of radicalization through the Internet.

The paper studies the spread of hate sentiments in online forums by collecting comment threads posted on dark-web forums containing a combination of benign posts and radical comments on the Islamic religion. By combining sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and graph theory, Le's research sheds light on the propagation of hate speech in online forums and the extent to which such speech can influence individuals.

Le will be presenting this innovative work at the CySoC workshop at The Web Conference in Austin, TX. Congratulations to Le on this outstanding achievement!
